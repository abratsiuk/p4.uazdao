## 📘 Overview

A React + TypeScript project dedicated to presenting the humorous and practical philosophy of **Uazdao**, inspired by the books of **Pavel Ievlev**.
The app visually reflects the concepts described in the novels: the UAZ-469 as a metaphor for complex systems, constant movement, and the impossibility of total perfection.

## 🎯 Description

* **Uazdao** is a practical philosophy focused on how to work with complex systems in real life.
* The author, **Pavel Ievlev**, is a science fiction writer and editor of an automotive website.
* In the books, the **UAZ-469** becomes a symbol of meditation and system thinking:

  * It always moves
  * It always breaks
  * It can always be repaired
  * But it can *never* be fully fixed
* The project visualizes and organizes this philosophy in a friendly, structured interface.
* The book belongs to a broader sci-fi universe spanning multiple worlds and timelines.
