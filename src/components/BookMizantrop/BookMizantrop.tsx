      <h3>Annotation</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>
          The only reason this book exists is because I felt like writing it.
        </li>
        <li>Reading this text may result in loss of mental virginity.</li>
        <li>It’s all true — except for the parts I made up.</li>
        <li>The book is written in the words that people really use.</li>
        <li>There is no plot, no heroes, no adventures.</li>
        <li>It’s not about love.</li>
        <li>This is a non-novel about nothing.</li>
        <li>
          The book might make you pull your head out of your ass — where it’s
          warm and cozy.
        </li>
        <li>But it won’t teach you anything.</li>
        <li>Because there is no such thing as “the right way to live.”</li>

      <h2>UAZdao. The Misanthrope’s Creed</h2>
      <h3>A non-novel about nothing</h3>

      <p>The UAZ drove through a dark forest</p>
      <p>Looking for something interesting.</p>
      <p>Inter-inter-interest...</p>
      <p>Why the hell did you come in here?</p>

      <h3>Chapter 1. Mind Blown</h3>
      <Image src="images/bookmizantrop/g1.jpg" alt="" />

      <p>UAZdao is a path with no goal, a process with no result,</p>
      <p>
        a start with no finish, a dick with no salt, and an ass with no handle.
      </p>

      <p>
        It all began with the UAZ. A metal can full of problems pretending to be
        a car.
      </p>
      <p>
        A car is a way to move your butt from point A to point B.
        <strong>
          The UAZ is a way to move your butt into an even bigger mess
        </strong>
        , where the cart will either get stuck, break down, or both — turning
        your life into a wild adventure. Like flying across the English Channel
        with a bunch of balloons filled with fart gas. Creative and exciting —
        but no guarantees.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyone who calls the UAZ a car has clearly never tried to actually reach
        somewhere in it. Not just “ride,” but “get there.” That difference is
        huge.
      </p>
      <p>UAZdao is not about the result — it’s about the process.</p>
      <p>
        Sure, it can move — no problem. It may even reach the destination — if
        you’re lucky, or have a tailwind, or a slope in your favor, or Mars is
        in Capricorn, or whatever else it takes to squeeze some luck out of Fate
        and run before it notices. But even if you reach point B, you’ll feel
        confused, not happy. “What, it’s over already?” you’ll ask the Universe.
        Because:
      </p>
      <p>The process has value. The result — is worthless.</p>

      <p>
        “Focus on results,” which society pumps into our brains like an enema,
        is just a clever trick. A way to make us miserable with our own hands.
        The only real <strong>result</strong> we will ever get in life is a
        stone with dates above worm food. And we won’t care what the stone looks
        like, because there will be no “us” anymore. Everything else — believe
        it or not — is a <strong>process</strong>. And they tell us it doesn’t
        matter. Life is a process, my friends! A process! Are you really chasing
        a result? You mean those dates on the stone? They’re coming no matter
        what.
      </p>

      <Image

      />

      <p>
        That’s why <strong>UAZ is a philosophy and a dao</strong>, not a
        vehicle. It changes how you see the world. It shifts your perspective,
        because it is the pure essence of process-for-the-sake-of-process. The
        person driving a UAZ is simply driving a UAZ. Where and why — those are
        small details compared to driving without power steering, double
        clutching the gears, and thinking which direction the thing will jump if
        you brake hard.
      </p>

      <p>***</p>

      <p>
        When I got my UAZ, it didn’t have brakes at all — but that didn’t stop
        me. It slowed down fine using the engine. That was the best thing the
        engine could do. And in emergencies — the metal bumper. The army
        engineers designed it to stop by hitting the armor of the tank in front
        of you. All other ways to stop were optional.
      </p>

      <p>
        The heater didn’t turn off, the steering had half a turn of free play,
        and sometimes the throttle linkage fell off. And at the end — the UAZ
        didn’t even fit into the garage in height, showing true commitment to
        the <i>process-not-result</i> idea, and highlighting my signature
        planning and foresight.
      </p>

      <p>I’m a total screw-up — and that, too, is part of UAZdao.</p>

      <p>
        UAZdao as a <i>“process-not-result”</i> means repairs that never end. A
        UAZ cannot be “fully fixed.” That word just doesn’t apply — same as
        “acceleration” or “handling.” Expecting “working condition” from it is
        like expecting vertical takeoff from a washing machine.
      </p>

      <p>Maybe it’s possible. But why would you want to?</p>

      <p>
        A UAZ that moves without the help of horses is considered ready for use,
        no matter how fast it moves. Fuel consumption, smoke, strange noises,
        working lights, and its ability to respond to the steering wheel — all
        these things are seen as unimportant in this philosophy. Don’t worry —
        enjoy the <b>process</b>.
      </p>

      <p>“Oh shit, it’s actually moving! It really moves!”</p>

      <Image src="images/bookmizantrop/g1_2.jpg" alt="" />

      <p>
        Don’t ask me why I needed a UAZ. I still don’t have an answer. Maybe the
        Wheels of Samsara (4x4, manual switch, with lock) brought it to me. As
        punishment for my automotive sins, or reward for my misanthropy, or
        maybe compensation for my social disability.
      </p>

      <p>
        War veterans were given special cars with hand controls. People damaged
        by modern society should be given a UAZ. It gives you the same things as
        society does: pain, shame, frustration, a feeling of being broken,
        danger in trusting others, and a full rainbow of disappointments. But
        unlike people — you can hit it with a sledgehammer. For some reason, you
        can’t do that to people.
      </p>

      <p>
        SMACKING — a simple but effective way to show your opinion in a
        conversation. #MisanthropeDictionary
      </p>

      <p>
        It really helps — with a sledgehammer. You look at someone, smile, and
        think: “If only I could hit you. With a sledgehammer. Again. And again.
        YOU, DAMN, ASS—!!”
      </p>

      <p>Great replacement for therapy.</p>

      <p>
        Therapy is overrated. Not just because there are 100 online-course
        graduates for every real specialist, but because people often use it the
        wrong way — in the wrong place.
      </p>

      <p>
        No, I’m not saying therapy doesn’t work. It scares me that sometimes it
        does. But it doesn’t fix problems — it only hides the pain. Like
        treating appendicitis with opioids — the pain goes away, and you die
        from peritonitis feeling nice and cozy.
      </p>

      <Image src="images/bookmizantrop/g1_3.jpg" alt="" />

      <p>
        To the question
        <i>“I feel like a piece of shit, and that makes me feel even worse”</i>,
        therapy often says “Accept it and enjoy it” instead of “Why don’t you
        stop being a piece of shit?” Of course, some people really can’t change.
        Their name is Legion.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Legion of LPS” — the general name for post-millennials. (LPS = Low
        Power Shit)
      </p>

      <p>
        But some people might have a chance — if instead of “accepting
        themselves,” someone gave them a magic kick in the lazy butt. Then they
        would leave the therapist and go live a normal life — and never come
        back. But what would the therapist eat then?
      </p>

      <p>
        So, if you're thinking about going to a therapist — better buy a UAZ.
        It’ll cost less in the long run, and it won’t look so shameful. A man in
        a UAZ — that’s strong. A man on a therapy couch — that’s just sad. In a
        man's life, there should be only two medical cases: the draft board and
        the coroner.
      </p>

      <p>In between — medicine has no business.</p>

      <p>* * *</p>

      <p>
        Me and the UAZ — we were a perfect match. We were almost the same age.
        I’m an old fart, and it’s ancient too. Modern cars don’t live that long.
        It’s a kind of automotive immortality — when only the frame and
        registration paper are left from the original car, but it’s still the
        same UAZ. I swear on the Registration Department of the State Traffic
        Inspectorate!
      </p>

      <p>
        The department that immediately told me to get lost — just like that,
        while I was still on temporary license plates.
        <i>Process-not-result</i> — that’s UAZdao!
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>
          “Why the hell is there no body number?” — asked the bored inspector.
        </i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“Because it’s an old UAZ — older than mammoth crap.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“Why the hell is there no frame number?”</i>
      </p>

          it right there — unnumbered part.”
        </i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>
          “— And how do I know which UAZ I’m registering? This one or some
          other?”
        </i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>
          “— Why do you care? A UAZ is a UAZ — even in Africa. I saw it myself —
          guys with rusty AKs chasing each other through bushes on them.”

      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“— Then take your damn UAZ to Africa, genius.”</i>
      </p>

      <p>
        Yep, that’s exactly what walking the Path of UAZdao looks like. Every
        step — straight into the shit, and it splashes high. On the way to the
        traffic office and back, it managed to overheat, lose its driveshaft
        mid-road, and hit “brown alert” for the cars nearby — jumping half a
        meter sideways every time I braked. Because{' '}
        <b>UAZdao is the path of adventure</b>.

      <p>
        So we returned to the Great Garage on the same temporary plates we left
        with. With the powerful magic of “grinder-welder-junkyard,” I raised the
        gate bar and gave it its place in my life. That’s how we, me and the
        UAZ, landed in the Great Garage and got stuck there for a long time,
        becoming part of its strange, uneventful reality.
      </p>

      <p>
        “So that UAZ rolled inside,
        <br />
        Parked its wheels side by side,
        <br />
        In the garage among the scrap,
        <br />
        Above the pit where wrenches nap.
        <br />
        <br />
        Days and weeks keep drifting by,
        <br />
        That beast just stands there like a lie,
        <br />
        In the garage among the scrap,
        <br />
        Above the pit where wrenches nap...”
      </p>

      <p>I wrote that — after a very, very long break — in verse.</p>

      <p>
        In the meter of the “Kalevala,” like Lemminkäinen on skis. If you’ve
        never read that monstrous Karelian-Finnish epic, you won’t understand
        the full depth of my Zen. But that’s UAZdao for you.
      </p>

      <p>
        Yes, I once wrote shitty poetry too. I’m not proud of it — but not too
        ashamed either. It’s an age thing, like masturbation. Pre-mating rituals
        of higher primates. Like birds’ throat songs or colorful ass feathers —
        meant to attract females when the male doesn’t yet have the main sign of
        sexual maturity in homo sapiens — a wallet bulging erotically from his
        pants.
      </p>

      <Image src="images/bookmizantrop/g1_5.jpg" alt="" />
      <p>
        And you know what — it worked! The poems were crap, I played guitar like
        I was strumming it with my dick, and my voice was terrible — but for the
        girls, it was enough. Young ladies in the “search-for-happiness” phase
        are not picky and very trusting.
      </p>
      <p>
        Great Universe, please don’t make my daughters pay for the sins of my

      </h4>

      <p>
        Living alone with metal teaches you the only right way to think. I would
        call it “the mental autonomy of UAZdao.” In the pre-information age, it
        was the main way to think. Want to think? — be alone in silence. And
        even back then, silence wasn’t easy to find, so people would go to
        monasteries, hide in small rooms, or walk into the desert. They worked
        with their hands and thought with their heads. That was their UAZdao.
      </p>

      <p>
        People say “man is a social being.” But that’s a cliché — and clichés
        are bullshit. Or at least dangerously oversimplified. Just like
        aphorisms — short, rhythmic phrases that turn off your brain and seem
        meaningful when they’re not. Primates are social, sure. Herd animals,
        even. But everything in humans that is not from chimpanzees works in the
        opposite way. When more than three of us gather, the average IQ drops to
        the level of the dumbest person — divided by how many are present. A
        crowd will believe anything if it’s shouted loud enough. Real work
        becomes less effective the more people do it — most of the time goes
        into “managing labor resources.” And creativity, once it becomes social,
        turns into a kind of “clown show for degenerates.” The gold standard of
        this, in a vacuum of intellect, is TV.
      </p>

      <Image src="images/bookmizantrop/g1_7.jpg" alt="" />

      <p>
        If you can’t find a way to be alone in silence — your thinking is
        screwed. And silence is getting harder to find in today’s noisy
        civilization. But we still have the Great Garage — the place of UAZdao.
      </p>

      <p>
        All our so-called “civilizational achievements” were born when someone
        finally got left alone and could think clearly. If that happened more
        often, we’d already have reached god-knows-what. Or we’d have wiped each
        other out — also possible. You sit, you think… And then you walk out of
        the garage — and there are people. You look at them, turn around, and
        invent the atomic bomb.
      </p>

      <p>Because, damn it, no one has the nerves for those people.</p>

      <p>
        For me, this garage period gave me a few books. They’re probably not
        important to anyone, but if they didn’t exist, my life would be much
        more boring. Still, I can understand the guy who invented the bomb.
      </p>

      <Image src="images/bookmizantrop/g1_8.jpg" alt="" />

      <p>I write books simply because I write them.</p>

      <p>
        I’ve heard that people write for money, for fame, or to tell Humanity
        something super important it can’t live without. Weird idea. A person
        dumb enough to think they’ll get rich and famous from writing books
        probably can’t write anything at all. Except maybe the word “DICK” in
        big letters on a toilet wall.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sure, there are rich and famous writers. A few. But if you compare that
        number to how many tried… Mathematically, you have better chances of
        winning the lottery. And that will get you on TV, at least. So the
        scammers who take dumb people’s money know your face. And even that’s
        more than a writer can usually expect.

      <p>
        As for Humanity — there are no words it hasn’t heard already. You won’t
        tell it anything new. Writing is also a process-not-result.
      </p>

      <p>Writing just to write — that’s what UAZdao is.</p>

      <p>
        That’s why I’m writing this nonsense you’re reading right now. I enjoy
        the process. Keys go click-click, letters line up, one word grabs the
        next — it’s calming. Hand movement is strangely connected to thinking.
        Sit on a chair, put your hands on your knees, stare at the wall — you
        won’t think of anything, no matter how hard you try. But if you’re
        tightening bolts, welding metal, connecting wires, or even just tapping
        keys — it’s different. Maybe something interesting will come out. Maybe.
        No promises.
      </p>

      <p>
        And if no one likes the result — well, screw it. The result doesn’t
        matter.
      </p>

      <p>
        When the internet was young, and I was stupid, I sometimes posted things
        other than cat pictures on my blog. Back then, the word “blogger” didn’t
        mean “some weird loser with no job.” Even decent people could be
        bloggers (not me). So no, I’m not ashamed. Don’t hope for that. (I
        already have enough shame in life — there’s not much left for small
        stuff.)
      </p>

      <p>
        That’s when I learned a universal rule: there is no such thing as a
        non-offensive text. Any meaningful group of words will offend someone
        deeply — down to their burning, aching ass. Just because the act of
        expressing a thought with words deeply triggers those who can only
        mumble, blow snot bubbles, and post other people’s memes.

        Some people always show up — totally serious — believing that some words
        are worse than others. Words, for fuck’s sake! So if you put letters in

        These are people who would erase the dick from existence if they could.
        But since they can’t, they try to at least remove the word. They think
        it’ll disappear on its own after that.
      </p>

      <p>
        They even have a phrase: “It feels like someone splashed me with filth.”
        That’s because these morons have shit in their heads — and a hole shaped
        like the word “dick.” Other words don’t fit into the hole. But those
        three letters drop in with such a splash that the shit flies out. That’s

        first glance it reads: “I judge you from my moral high ground.” Which is
        basically the same, but some people get confused. It's easy to tell them
        apart from the honest fools who just want to “make people better.”
      </p>
      <p>
        A prude’s motivation is not to change anything — it's the joy of judging
        others.

      <h3>The Master and the Prudes</h3>

      <p>
        <i>
          One day, some Prudes came into the Master’s garage. Wrinkling their
          noses and looking around, they said:
        </i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“Hello. We are prudes. We came to judge you.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“But why?” the Master asked, surprised.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>The Prudes looked at each other and nodded in satisfaction.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>
          “We heard you used the ‘b’ word, and even the ‘yo’ word. Don’t deny it
          — we waited half a day outside your gate to catch it.”
        </i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>
          “Well, you see... the wrench slipped... the nut... the thread... got
          messed u— oh…” the Master mumbled in embarrassment.
        </i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>
          “Swearing is disgusting!” said the oldest Prude. “Like getting
          splashed with filth! We judge you!”
        </i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>
          “Just judge?” asked the smallest Prude, taking notes in his notebook.
        </i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“We strongly judge!”</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“Strongly... got it,” he scribbled.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“Also, your place is filthy!” the Prudes said with disgust.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>
          “But it’s just... rags... oil... scrap. A working garage, see?” the
          Master said, trying to block the biggest pile of junk with his body.
        </i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>
          “It’s unpleasant to look at!” said the Prudes. “We totally judge you!”
        </i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“Totally...” mumbled the note-taker.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>
          “Maybe... you don’t have to look?” the Master asked carefully. “You
          came here — I didn’t come to you...”
        </i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>
          “By the way,” said the Lady Prude, her voice sharp like a hacksaw,
          “you look messy. That beard… dirt under your nails! Why not get a
          manicure? Visit a barber shop?”
        </i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“But... I work with my hands! How can I do that with a manicure?”</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“I don’t care. I don’t want to see it. I judge you. Publicly.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“...publicly...” the small Prude wrote down.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>
          “But I’m not making you look at me!” the Master said, embarrassed.
        </i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“You fix cars — they pollute and kill people.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“But...”</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“We judge you!”</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“You smoke! That’s disgusting! Why should we smell your stink?”</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“But I’m just here... You came to me...”</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“We judge you!”</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“You drink! We saw a shot glass!”</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“What does it matter to anyone...”</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>
          “That’s awful — what kind of example are you giving to children?!”
          said the Head Prude, scratching his purple nose.
        </i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“What children?”</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“Him!” he pointed toward the little Prude with the notebook.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“But you brought him with you!”</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>
          “We judge! We judge! We judge!” the Prudes all shouted at once, not
          letting the Master speak.
        </i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>
          And then the Lady Prude suddenly said: “Shit, fuck!” And everyone went
          silent.
        </i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>
          “What the hell is this crap?” she said, looking at the oil stain on
          her expensive shoes. “This is just bullshit!”
        </i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>The Lady Prude pulled out a cigarette and nervously lit it.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>
          “Should we judge her?” the little Prude asked quietly, glancing at his
          notebook.
        </i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>
          “Are you stupid?” the Head Prude snapped, taking a swig from a hip
          flask. “Let’s go. There’s a nudist beach nearby — we need to go judge
          public indecency. It’s behind a three-meter fence, but if we climb a
          pine tree and bring binoculars…”
        </i>
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        <i>
          The Master watched them leave, thoughtfully cleaning his fingernails
          with a screwdriver.

        If the traffic police registration office told you to get lost — that's
        not the final level of pain and humiliation. There’s still the expert
        inspection. There, specially trained people will also look at you like
        you’re crap — but using instruments.

        In the morning, I watched a line forming behind me. It was a line into
        my damn future — old, grumpy men with UAZes. In each grumbling,
        spitting, swearing old fart warming his hemorrhoids on a hot hood, I saw
        my future self. Looking back, I can confirm — I wasn’t wrong.
      </p>

      <p>
        A typical UAZ owner is a classic Old Fart. Master of blue duct tape and
        tree-shit-based* tuning, never throws away old parts, and has never
        heard the word “auto repair shop.” Even if the mirror shows someone
        different right now — don’t worry. Your time will come. Grey beard,
        taped-up glasses, warm hood, and a bad temper await you. Hemorrhoids
        start right away.
      </p>

      <p>This is UAZdao!</p>
