      <h3>Annotation</h3>

      <p>
        Reader, in front of you is "UAZdao". It is a book about a special,
        garage Dao, where sparks from an angle grinder, welding light, and hot
        oil splashes create something that many people mistakenly call wisdom.
        This is a book of common sense.
      </p>
      <p>
        This book has many smart words, many correct words, and many swear
        words. What it doesn’t have is a single serious word.
      </p>
      <p>
        May the universe protect you from reading any of this too seriously!
      </p>

      <h3>Prologue — a manuscript found in grease</h3>

      <p>
        During excavations of an ancient garage site, a tightly sealed tin
        amphora filled with grease was found. Inside was a manuscript of a great
        sacred text that was thought to be lost forever. It contains the
        earliest copies of what is known as "UAZdao" — the holy book of ancient
        car mechanics. Until now, it was only known from short fragments passed
        down by word of mouth.
      </p>

      <p>
        The manuscript is written in the old proto-language of car mechanics, so
        some terms and idiomatic expressions remain untranslated. These are
        usually the sacred, magic words that, even without their original
        meaning, are still passed down from master to student. Normally, they
        are spoken after hitting one’s finger with a hammer...
      </p>

      <p>
        The manuscript was created using traditional technology — a screwdriver
        on leatherette — and its decoding is still in progress.
      </p>

      <h3>Descent into the UAZ</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          May the eternal Angle Grinder, Welder, and Junkyard be with you, for
          their path is the path of UAZdao.
        </li>
        <li>And also the Crowbar and the Sledgehammer — their messengers.</li>
        <li>And never ignore the Chisel.</li>
        <li>
          Do not be proud and refuse the open-end wrench, just because you have
          a socket one. The path of UAZdao is the path of simplicity. And what
          will you do if you lose the socket one?
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        I found myself on the thorny and endlessly enlightening path of UAZdao
        partly by accident. But really, every person can say this about any
        situation in life — because life itself is just a Big Coincidence. Some
        things simply appear in your life from nowhere, for no reason, and
        suddenly fit in perfectly. They grow into your daily routine and take
        root. And one day, you feel they have always been there — and you can’t
        imagine life without them.
      </p>

      <p>
        That’s how the UAZ came into my life. It just happened to me — and it
        changed my life. Well, at least as much as life — this strange thing —
        can be changed at all.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was a very basic UAZ-469 from the early years, the “kolkhoz version.”
        Split windshield, wipers on top, carburetor engine for 80-octane fuel,
        stool-like seats inside, and a homemade hardtop.
      </p>

      <p>
        No romance. Just a working car for rural tasks, a helper in village
        logistics.
      </p>

      <p>Why? — you may ask.</p>

      <p>
        My school physics teacher — a very unique man — used to put on a real
        show when someone asked why electrons move in orbits, or why electric
        current goes from plus to minus and not the other way. He would open his
        eyes wide, make a shocked face (like we were very stupid), stand up
        straight in front of the class and say: “What? You don’t know THIS? Take
        your pens and notebooks RIGHT NOW! Write this down in big letters so you
        remember it for life! Ready? Write: ‘THIS IS HOW THE WORLD WORKS!’” From
        that time, I understood: we can’t always know why things happen — and we
        don’t need to. Current flows, electrons spin, and the world is complex
        and not always clear. It is like this, because it is not another way. We
        can often explain “how?”, almost never “why?”, and the question “what
        for?” often makes no sense at all.
      </p>

      <p>
        For example — why do I need a UAZ? Wrong question. Why do I need myself?
      </p>

      <p>
        A person needs some way to connect with the world — something that helps
        go beyond the everyday useful life. The UAZ is my personal way to do
        something useless — not better, not worse than other ways. In fact, the
        ability to do useless things is an important skill, though people don’t
        always see it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Most of the time, we are just producing ourselves. Turning resources
        from the world into our own life. That’s utility — and every living
        being does that. Doing useful things, in all forms. But humans have a
        special word — “work” — and many don’t understand how important it is.
        This word separates useful actions into their own category, which means:
        there is also something else. Not work. And that “something else” is not
        rest. Rest is just a part of the working process — to restore energy.
        But doing something useless — that is what makes us human. Not just
        machines that turn food into fertilizer and back.
      </p>

      <p>
        Doing useless things is not silly. It is a self-statement. Building a
        house — that’s useful. Carving patterns on window frames — that’s
        useless. Planting potatoes — you can eat them. Planting flowers — why?
        But this useless thing changes the world around us, makes it our
        creation. And most of all — it changes us.
      </p>

      <p>
        Hunting a mammoth — that’s a useful thing. Drawing this hunt on a cave
        wall — that’s a useless thing. (What did you say? Ritual? Magic?
        Ceremony? — Oh, come on! The artist just needed a way to explain himself
        to the other tribe members when they asked the same stupid question:
        “Why are you doing this?” When most of your communication is hitting
        with a heavy stick, it’s hard to explain abstract ideas.) It seems like
        nothing — just painting with ochre on a wall — but then the skull grew
        bigger, the jaw moved forward, eyebrows went in, and the brain got
        smarter. Suddenly — no more mammoths. There’s asphalt, internet, and
        hipsters everywhere. Sometimes you think: maybe the one with ochre
        should’ve been hit with that stick after all…
      </p>

      <p>
        Not every machine has its own Dao. But the UAZ is very different from
        all the other cars I’ve used. Let me explain it clearly, so I don’t have
        to repeat it: The UAZ is not a car. It’s not a vehicle. Moving a person
        from point A to point B is just something it sometimes does — not its
        real purpose. Almost any other car does that better.
      </p>

      <p>
        The UAZ is an adventure. Every ride is like going to space, or an
        expedition to Antarctica, or crossing the ocean on a raft made of beer
        cans, or flying over the English Channel with 1000 hydrogen balloons.
      </p>

      <p>It’s a jump into the unknown — and the result is never certain.</p>

      <p>
        I understood everything right away when I drove my newly bought UAZ from
        a faraway village to its new home — the Great Garage. For example, I
        realized the wisdom of the designers who added a metal bumper bar. What
        is it for? — It’s for braking by hitting the tank in front of you. There
        were no other ways to stop. The steering wheel? — It’s for holding on
        during bumps. Turning it doesn’t really change the car’s direction. Oh,
        and the heater never turned off — which, at 42°C heat, gave the trip
        some extra spice.
      </p>

      <p>
        The car refused to go in any gear higher than third — it didn’t have
        enough power. But since there were no brakes, that was probably a good
        thing... I didn’t reach the garage by just a few kilometers — the
        throttle linkage broke into small pieces. But the happy previous owner
        gave me so many spare parts that all I needed to build another UAZ was
        the frame.
      </p>

      <p>
        For it is said:
        <ul>
          <li>There is no such thing as extra parts.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h3>The Great Garage</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>
          If your nut doesn’t go on your bolt’s thread — don’t grab your Pipe
          too fast. First, turn on your brain and ask yourself: is it the right
          nut? Is it the right thread?
        </li>
        <li>
          Don’t use your Tool before your Head, or you may look with horror at
          what you have done. Some grab the Angle Grinder without thinking — and
          even the Welder can’t help after that...
        </li>
        <li>
          The one who follows the Path of UAZDAO always expects trouble. But
          only the True Master of the Path is always ready — his Grinder disc is
          fresh, and his Welder tank is full.
        </li>
        <li>
          Let your Garage be messy and your trunk full of junk — but the mind of
          the one who follows the Path must stay clean. Because everything is on
          the Path.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        “If a tram runs over you, you’ll scream at first. It runs over you once,
        twice... — and then you get used to it!”
      </p>

      <p>
        At that moment, I was already in the final stage of tram adaptation. In
        every life, there’s always some crap. But sometimes it feels like
        there’s nothing except that. Sometimes you need to do something about
        it. Sometimes you need to stop doing what you always did. If life knocks
        you out, maybe the best thing is just to lie on the ring for a while —
        not jump up and get hit again. Sure, you can dance around like a shaman,
        beating your chest instead of a drum and shouting to the Universe,
        “Crap, crap, you are here!” You can also cry in public and try to get
        sympathy from the cold-hearted society. But it’s more honest to crawl to
        the side, hide behind the wall, and think: how did I end up like this?
      </p>

      <p>
        So I crawled into the Great Garage, slowly — and even with some pleasure
        — diving into its strange life. There’s a kind of escape here. And to
        feel it fully, you have to go deep. Just coming here on weekends to wipe
        the windows and kick the tires won’t help. You need to live it. It’s
        like a monastery — you can visit it, or go as a pilgrim, but that’s not
        enough. To understand what people are doing here, you need to live their
        life — for more than a day or two. It’s also a kind of escape — just
        with more traditional magic.
      </p>

      <p>
        The moment you first sleep in the Garage is when the magic starts. Maybe
        because you have nowhere to go. Maybe because you don’t need to go.
        Maybe you’re just lazy. Or maybe you’re drunk and you don’t want to go,
        don’t need to go, and don’t know where to go. Who the hell cares where
        you sleep? There’s the short cot, a sleeping bag from the car, an
        inflatable pillow, and a bottle of lullaby in the mini fridge. And when
        you sit on the flat roof in an old seat from a “Moskvich,” breathing the
        smell of cooling tar, and you watch the huge, crazy-colored moon cutting
        the big field into sharp-shadowed squares — that’s when the Garage
        accepts you. And you understand something about it — and about yourself.
      </p>

      <p>
        Or maybe it doesn’t accept you. Then you’re just a drunk, lonely fool on
        a garage roof. Go to sleep.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’m a slow, skeptical cynic. I had to sit like that many nights. Sit,
        smoke, sip from the bottle, and lean back in an old chair rocking on its
        crooked legs. Think, think — and then stop thinking. Just stare at the
        Moon with empty eyes. If not for the UAZ under me in the garage, I
        probably wouldn’t understand anything. But it fits this place so
        perfectly, it became my interface to the Great Garage.
      </p>

      <p>
        The UAZ often brought people to me — and me to people. For some reason,
        it never leaves anyone indifferent. It somehow marks that point in the
        Universe — that point which is me. And that night, it was summer, night,
        moon, a bottle of whiskey, and a lot of quiet, sad emptiness… which was
        broken in the most unexpected way.
      </p>

      <p>“— Yuhhyersh, yevyek?”</p>

      <p>
        If I hadn’t been too drunk to move quickly, I might have jumped in fear
        and fallen off the garage headfirst — and that would’ve been the end of
        my story. But the alcohol blocked the adrenaline, so I didn’t even shit
        myself. Not even a little. Just imagine — night, full moon, silence, a
        360-degree view, and complete loneliness. And then someone whispers
        something strange in your ear. That’s… surprising, to say the least.
      </p>

      <p>“— Yuhhyersh, ashooyuh? Yusteersh?”</p>

      <p>
        The black shape behind my shoulder wasn’t the angel of death — or I
        wouldn’t be telling this story now. Trying to see someone when you’re
        drunk, in high-contrast moonlight, is hard. At first, I thought it was a
        child — like Gavroche in ragged clothes. A street kid from an old movie.
        Maybe it was the way he talked — swallowing beginnings of words,
        lisping, mixing up sounds — like some small kids do. But then, when I
        turned and the moonlight hit him differently, he looked like an old
        shriveled man. A grandpa with no teeth, speech messed up from age. But
        no — he had all his teeth. And he wasn’t old. Honestly, you couldn’t
        tell his age from his face. But from the way he acted, I felt he was
        more like a teenager. He was short — maybe a meter and a cap — and
        looked like a hobo. That’s what I thought after I caught my breath —
        just some homeless guy. Which was weird, because there were no homeless
        people in the Garage place. What would they do there? Still, not the
        strangest thing I’ve ever seen.
      </p>

      <p>“— What do you want?” I asked, not very friendly.</p>

      <p>“— Yusteersh?”</p>

      <p>
        “— What? I don’t understand!” I started getting annoyed. I don’t like
        hobos, you know. Not for any real reason — just... I don’t like them.
        That smell... Though, to be honest, he didn’t smell at all. Not like a
        hobo — not like anything. Maybe that’s why talking to him always felt a
        bit unreal.
      </p>

      <p>“— Who are you, anyway?”</p>

      <p>“— Sandr a.”</p>

      <p>“— Alexander? Sasha?”</p>

      <p>“— No. Not Xandr, not Sasha. Sandr. Sandr a.”</p>

      <p>
        It was hard to understand him at first, but later I got used to it.
        Still, even when I learned to follow his strange, mumbled fast-talking,
        I never really figured out his name. He strongly protested against
        “Alexander.” I couldn’t think of anything closer — so he stayed Sandr.
      </p>

      <p>“— So what do you want, Sandr?”</p>

      <p>
        He stood there, looking a bit shy, kicked the ground with his foot,
        shrugged his little shoulders — I thought for sure he was going to ask
        for a drink. I wouldn’t mind sharing, but I don’t like pushy people, and
        I didn’t need company. So I was already preparing a polite way to say
        no. But the little guy surprised me.
