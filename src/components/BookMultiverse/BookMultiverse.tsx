      <p>“— Boss, why are they here?”</p>
      <p>“— Krispy, why are we here?”</p>
      <p>
        Both phrases hissed in angry whispers from opposite ends of the table.
      </p>
      <p>
        “— It’s necessary, Pyotr,” Andrey replied with a displeased hiss. “I’ll
        explain later.”
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>...</p>
      <br />
      <p>Andrey paced again from corner to corner, bit his lip, and added:</p>
      <p>
        “— And once again for everyone: whatever they do here, whatever nonsense
        they say — we smile, nod, agree, and calmly keep doing our work.
        Hopefully, they won’t last long. They’ll show up, mess things up, then
        bounce off to save the Multiverse. Alright, enough sitting around. Let’s
        get to work.”
      </p>
      <p>
        In the deepening evening twilight, no one noticed how a girl carefully
        slipped out from the thick bushes near the gazebo, looked around
        attentively, and quietly disappeared around the corner of the house.
      </p>
      <h3>Chapter 2. Green</h3>
      <p>
        In today’s relaxed, consumer-driven times, the sacred meaning of garages
        has mostly been lost. First, they changed from a male habitat — the last
        mono-gender sanctuary in a rapidly feminizing society — into boring
        storage for cars. Repair work stopped being a source of self-realization
        and moved into cold, indifferent service centers. And even the cars
        themselves lost that spark of soul once given to them by the caring,
        skilled hands of their owners.
      </p>
      <p>
        Still, the Great Garage itself — that massive sprawl of brick boxes
        joined side by side — holds a strange kind of magic. The trigger to
        activate it is the first time you spend the night there. Because you
        have nowhere to go. Or no reason to go. Or you’re just lazy. Or you’re
        drunk, and you have nowhere to go, no reason, and no desire to move. Who
        the hell cares where you sleep? Here’s a short, worn-out cot, a sleeping
        bag from the car, a small inflatable pillow, and a bottle of bedtime
        potion in a mini-fridge. And then, sitting on the flat roof in a sunken
        old seat, breathing in the smell of cooling tar, watching the massive,
        lunatic-colored moon slash the field with sharp shadows into square
        driveways — the Garage suddenly accepts you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Or it doesn’t. Then you’re just a drunk, lonely idiot on a garage roof.
        Go to bed already.
      </p>
      <p>
        I crashed into the Garage like a boxer knocked out cold. If life hits
        you hard in the head, it’s not for nothing. Sometimes the best strategy
        is to just lie there in the corner of the ring for a bit, instead of
        jumping back up to get hit again. Crawl to the side, fall behind the
        baseboard, and think: how the hell did it come to this?
      </p>
      <p>
        Suddenly losing everything that used to be my life, I started living in
        the garage. On a cot between the workbench and the rear bumper — it was
        even kind of cozy. At some point, you realize — it’s not that bad. If
        you’ve got nothing, you’ve got nothing to lose. And someone with nothing
        to lose lives easier and without fear. Sitting on the roof at night,
        smoking, sipping from the bottle, leaning back again in a crooked,
        rocking car seat. Thinking, thinking — and then not thinking at all,
        staring blankly at the moon, slowly and with a strange kind of pleasure
        dissolving into this half-life that soaks this place. A unique kind of
        escapism lives here — and it demands a deep dive into the local
        philosophy of “non-resistance to the Ass of Destiny.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Relax, my friend,” the Garage tells you, patting your shoulder with a
        dirty, gnarled mechanic’s hand. “Everything’s already happened. Sit
        down, calm down, have a drink. Listen to how quiet it is here. You
        fought, worked, endured, struggled, loved and hated — and where is it
        all now? Do you really want back into that meat grinder? Forget it, man.
        You don’t need that much, not really.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Due to circumstances I’d prefer to leave out of this story, the only
        real estate I had left was an old garage, and the only vehicle — an old
        UAZ. Because they were basically worthless, no one else claimed them.
        And — looking for positives — no one claimed me either. A special kind
        of freedom: when you are truly, absolutely unnecessary to anyone. So —
        it was summer, night, moonlight, a bottle, and a lot of sad, empty
        thinking, which was suddenly interrupted in the most unexpected way.
      </p>
      <p>“Utáyesh, yevek?”</p>
      <p>
        If I hadn’t been too drunk for sudden moves, I might’ve jumped from
        fright and fallen headfirst off the garage — ending this story right
        there. But the alcohol blocked the adrenaline, and I didn’t even flinch.
        Still — it was night, the moon, complete silence, a 360° view, and I was
        absolutely alone. And then someone whispers in your ear. That’s…
        unexpected, to put it mildly.
      </p>
      <p>“Utáyesh, áshuyu? Ustísh?”</p>
      <p>
        The black silhouette behind me wasn’t the Angel of Death — otherwise who
        would be telling you this now? In the ultra-contrasted moonlight I first
        thought it was a weird kid — a kind of Gavroche in oversized
        hand-me-downs. Like a homeless child from an old movie. Maybe it was the
        way he talked — swallowing word beginnings, lisping, mixing up
        consonants — like little kids sometimes do. But when I turned and the
        light hit differently, he looked like an ancient, shrunken old man with
        speech issues from missing teeth. But no — he had teeth. And he wasn’t
        really old either. It was impossible to guess his age. Short — barely
        over a meter with his cap — and scruffy, borderline homeless. That’s
        what I figured in the moment, catching my breath — some drifter bum.
        Odd, though — bums don’t hang around the Garage Complex. What would they
        do here? But then again — I’ve seen weirder.
      </p>
      <p>“— What do you want?” I asked, not very kindly.</p>
      <p>“— Utísh?”</p>
      <p>
        “— What? I don’t understand!” I was starting to get annoyed. I don’t
        like bums, you know. Not for anything specific — just in general. I find
        them gross. That smell… Although this one didn’t smell. Not like a bum,
        not like anything at all. Maybe that’s why there was this weird feeling
        of unreality whenever I talked to him.
      </p>
      <p>“— Who are you, anyway?”</p>
      <p>“— Sandr a.”</p>
      <p>“— Alexander? Sasha?”</p>
      <p>“— No. Not ‘xandr’, not ‘asha’. Sandr. Sandr a.”</p>
      <p>
        It was hard to understand him at first, but eventually I adapted. Even
        when I got used to his mumbled, garbled speech, I still had no idea what
        his real name was. He kept passionately rejecting “Alexander,” and I
        couldn’t think of anything closer — so Sandr it was.
      </p>
      <p>“— And what do you want, Sandr?”</p>
      <p>
        He fidgeted, scraped his foot on the ground, shrugged his little
        shoulders — I figured, for sure, he was about to ask for a drink. Not
        that I minded much, but I don’t like pushiness, and I wasn’t in the mood
        for company. So I was already mentally preparing a polite but firm “no.”
        But the little guy surprised me.
      </p>
      <p>“— UAZ?” he pointed at the roof. “UAZ yours?”</p>
      <p>Those were the first words he said that I actually understood.</p>
      <p>
        “— Yeah, it’s my UAZ. The damned rust-bucket, bless its iron mother,” I
        muttered, full of technical pessimism and leftover bitterness.
      </p>
      <p>“— UAZ is good,” Sandr nodded seriously.</p>
      <p>
        “— Yeah, UAZ is good,” I agreed, just to avoid going into detail.
        Because sure, sometimes it’s good — but more often it’s crooked, rusty,
        and screwed on all wrong. Just like everything else in my life. It’s no
        coincidence me and that UAZ found each other.
      </p>
      <p>“— UAZ... big thunder... UAZ needed,” said that strange little man.</p>
      <p>
        “— Needed for what?” I asked lazily, taking a sip from the bottle. I
        didn’t bother with glasses — hygiene, you know. Dirty glasses are
        disgusting, and fetching clean water meant a trip to the pump all the
        way across the Garage Complex.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not hearing a response, I turned — but there was no one behind me
        anymore. Sandr had vanished as silently and mysteriously as he had
        appeared. It would’ve felt properly eerie if I hadn’t been drunk, and it
        wasn’t the middle of the night with the moon above and all that. Things
        always feel spooky at times like that — until you wake up, parched, and
        realize there was no mystery at all. So, I didn’t pay much attention to
        that weird little meeting — which was a mistake. That’s where everything
        started.
      </p>
      <Image src="images/bookmultiverse/g1_1.jpg" alt="" />
      <p>
        The Great Garage was sprinkled with tiny, very tiny, and even
        microscopic car repair shops. I joined their ranks with my little
        garage. If you’re alone and not ambitious, you need very little. I tried
        not to think about what would happen in winter. I lived one day at a
        time, one client at a time, with the usual “something’s knocking in
        there” or “burning oil — take a look.” Honestly, not the worst job in
        the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a child, I used to think the worst job ever was being a morgue
        assistant. I was really afraid of dead bodies back then, and just being
        in the same room with one seemed like a waking nightmare. So I figured
        morgue workers got paid insane amounts of money — because who else would
        do something so awful for less? (When I found out the truth… well, the
        world didn’t collapse — but it definitely wobbled.)
      </p>
      <p>
        In school, I thought nothing could be worse than being a plumber.
        Crawling into places where other people shit? Yuck! But I already didn’t
        believe they were paid well — by then, I was starting to suspect that
        the world was more often unfair than fair.
      </p>
      <p>
        Later, I realized that there are far more crappy jobs than good ones,
        and the heavier, dirtier, and more disgusting the job, the worse it’s
        paid. I accepted that as a fact of life, but deep down I still can’t
        understand why some file-shuffling office drone in an air-conditioned
        room gets paid more than the guy in an orange vest shoveling hot asphalt
        under the burning sun. I mean, the guy’s clearly working harder — and
        helping more people, too!
      </p>
      <p>
        That’s why, for a long time, my personal ranking of terrible human jobs
        was topped by anything involving a shovel. I believed that object
        carried a real Ancient Curse: if your job involved direct contact with a
        shovel — that’s it, you were guaranteed long, miserable, heavy labor in
        shitty conditions for worthless pay.
      </p>
      <p>
        But recently, one job has taken the absolute top spot in my Worst Jobs
        list…
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>The Man Who Points Left With a Stick!</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        He stands in the underground parking lot of a supermarket, in a
        reflective yellow vest, and points left with a stick. Morning and
        evening, in heat and frost, he stands there, in the dim exit lane, in a
        cloud of exhaust fumes, and points. With a stick. Left. Always the same
        spot. Always the same pose. Hour after hour, day after day. He stands.
        He points.
      </p>
      <p>
        Maybe sometimes he gets to point his stick in another direction. Like
        holding it up in a “Stop!” gesture. After all, the very fact that he
        stands there must mean he’s meant to react to circumstances. Otherwise,
        they’d just paint an arrow on the wall. I imagine on those days, it’s
        like a holiday for him. He comes home, demands a shot of vodka with
        dinner, and says to his wife, “Call the children!” The kids come in,
        timidly standing at the kitchen door. He drinks the vodka in one proud
        gulp, slams the glass down, and says: “You know what? Today, I signaled
        ‘Stop!’ with my stick! It was thrilling — such responsibility! But I did
        great.” And the kids, of course, are proud of their father and dream of
        growing up — so they too can Point Left With a Stick.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sadly, my vast life experience prevents me from believing that this
        remarkable job pays well. I doubt there’s much career growth either — I
        don’t think he’d even make it to Boom Gate Operator. Those booths are
        always staffed by women, and they have gender-based gatekeeper
        discrimination. That mafia is locked down tight — all the best spots go
        to insiders. So he’ll stand there forever, pointing left, until the
        constant drafts and exhaust fumes finally do him in. At his funeral will
        be the gate-lifting ladies, the carefree cart collectors, the grumpy
        cleaners, and even his colleague from the far side of the parking lot —
        The Man Who Points Right With a Stick. They’ll drink vodka at the wake
        and talk about how well the deceased pointed left, how he once even got
        to signal “Stop!” — and did it perfectly. A worthy man. Lived a good
        life. We should all be so lucky.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’d like to think they’ll lay a yellow vest and striped stick in his
        coffin, and carve on his gravestone: “He Pointed Left With a Stick!” But
        probably not. People who point with sticks usually lack imagination.
        They’ll bury him like everyone else — with an oval ceramic portrait and
        dates. His role in the world will remain unknown to future generations.
      </p>
      <p>
        And when I feel down, like life has no meaning — I always remember The
        Man Who Points Left With a Stick. And I feel better.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        In the morning, one of the neighbors was listening to “Radio Dacha” in
        their garage. The existence of this station, in my opinion, is enough to
        disprove the theory of Divine Creation. A God who made golden sunsets,
        misty dawns, emerald seas, and moonlit snowy mountains would never allow
        something as vile as “Radio Dacha” to exist in His creation. The mere
        broadcast of that station would justify another Great Flood. And if we
        consider the existence of “Radio Chanson” — then frankly, a good comet
        strike followed by a new ice age wouldn’t be overkill. Some things just
        require extreme measures.
      </p>
      <p>
        There were no clients, so I was tinkering with the UAZ. There's always
        something to tinker with. The engine was running, but there was a
        strange sound. A kind of light tapping on every fourth stroke. Probably
        nothing serious, but still weird. I’d been poking around with a
        mechanic’s stethoscope for half an hour trying to figure it out. No
        luck: too dull to be valve gear, too sharp for pistons. They sound
        different — piston sounds usually get muffled by the coolant jacket. I'd
        have said maybe the piston skirt was slapping the cylinder wall… or the
        wrist pin was loose. But not a valve gap — I’d checked those first. I
        kept listening, poking around — and when I finally came up for air,
        Sandr was standing right there. You know, the one from the roof. And
        here I thought I’d just hallucinated him while drunk.
      </p>
      <p>“— Yeet!”</p>
      <p>
        “— Hey there,” I nodded and offered a mechanic’s handshake — palm in,
        wrist first — because, well, my hand was covered in oil.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sandr gently grabbed my forearm with two fingers and stared at the
        engine like he’d never seen anything more fascinating in his life.
      </p>
      <p>“— It runs, see?” I boasted.</p>
      <p>Sandr pointed at the engine with a thin, grubby finger and said:</p>
      <p>“— Not wight.”</p>
      <p>“— What’s not right?”</p>
      <p>“— This fing. It opens bad. Wong.”</p>
      <p>“— What thing? What does it open wrong?”</p>
      <p>
        I really can’t stand those types, you know the ones — they make a wise
        face, point at something, and mutter some nonsense like “Maybe clean the
        carb” or “Could be the spark plugs” — because those are the only parts
        they know. Their dad showed them once on an old Moskvitch when they were
        kids.
      </p>
      <p>“— Don’t know word.”</p>
      <p>“— Then why talk if you don’t know?”</p>
      <p>“— Don’t know name. But I see it. It wrong.”</p>
      <p>
        Right. He just “sees” it. “I’m an artist, that’s how I see things.” Ugh.
      </p>
      <p>
        In daylight, Sandr looked less like a bum and not at all like a teen.
        Small and wiry, not quite in rags, but definitely wearing clothes meant
        for someone much broader, he had something odd in his face and
        movements. Not obvious, but noticeable. And that’s not even mentioning
        his speech. Though, to be fair, he was much easier to understand than
        this text makes it seem — you could guess most words from tone and
        stress patterns.
      </p>
      <p>“— Oh!” Sandr suddenly lit up. “I bwings Yozzi!”</p>
      <p>
        “— Brings who?” I asked — one second too late. Sandr was already gone,
        vanishing from view like he always did. But I didn’t have time to chase
        after him anyway. Giving up my hopeless engine stethoscope session, I
        sighed and slid under the car to mess with the suspension. Which, to be
        honest, is practically a vacation. Sort of like a beach resort. I’m
        lying on the sand — in front of the garage. The UAZ shades me from the
        sun, and I’m applying various lubricants to the exposed parts of my
        body…
      </p>
      <p>
        This is called “greasing” — a skill modern car owners have lost. Oh, the
        sweet word: greasing! How naive and innocent today’s drivers are, never
        having seen a grease gun, never having pressed it into a nipple, never
        having watched old grease ooze out as new grease pushes in… There’s
        something raw, primal, even intimate in that act — it reflects a deep,
        almost spiritual bond between driver and machine.
      </p>

      <p>
        People talk about grease fittings as a flaw in old cars, but for me,
        it’s just a different mindset — one not ruined by the throwaway culture
        of modern civilization.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the UAZ, very few parts actually need to be replaced from wear.
        Almost every component can be repaired — quickly reassembled on the spot
        by the dumbest army private under enemy fire, using only a hammer,
        pliers, and a few colorful curses. Sure, there are rubber bits — those
        wear out. But the rest is steel and cast iron, and everything comes
        apart, unscrews, unbolts, unplugs.
      </p>

      <p>
        The UAZ is not just a 20th-century vehicle by its year of manufacture —
        it’s a product of a bygone worldview. A car from the era of scarcity. A
        time when everything was rare, and things were valued because they were
        hard to replace. Mine, for example, is over thirty years old — and
        there’s nothing stopping it from going another thirty. Not because it’s
        technically brilliant — ha! far from it — but because it was made for
        endless repair. The UAZ is never fully functional, but it can stay like
        that pretty much forever. As long as the owner doesn’t get tired of
        fixing it. That doesn’t make it better than modern cars — which require
        less attention but can’t be fixed. It’s just a different philosophy,
        born in a different time — a time with fewer resources and more time.
        Kinda like my life right now.
      </p>

      <p>
        When I crawled out from under the UAZ feet first, I saw a very
        proud-looking Sandr standing next to a new guy. He was short too, but
        unlike Sandr, had broad shoulders and gave off a solid, confident vibe.
        Still, there was something in their appearance — a faint similarity,
        like distant relatives, or maybe people from the same small ethnic
        group.
      </p>

      <p>
        “This is Yozzi!” Sandr said with importance, emphasizing the name like
        he’d brought a nobleman or something.
      </p>

      <p>“I’m Yozzi,” the newcomer confirmed. “Nice to meet you.”</p>

      <p>
        Well, at least he didn’t have a speech problem. Actually, I liked him
        right away. Friendly, open face, firm handshake without macho crushing,
        and a wide, genuine smile that showed small, sharp, very white teeth. I
        assumed the name was a shortened version of Joseph — common in biblical
        cultures, not just among Jews. Later, I’d find out the similarity was
        purely coincidental.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Zelyony,” I introduced myself, as usual. They called me that after the
        mechanic from the cartoon *The Mystery of the Third Planet* — for my
        beard, feel for machines, pessimism, and melancholia. “What’s wrong this
        time?”, “This won’t end well!” — and other classic lines.
      </p>

      <p>
        Yozzi wasn’t surprised by the name. While I was wiping grease off my
        hands — I’d just finished stuffing steering knuckles with grease — he,
        without a second thought, ducked under the UAZ and popped the hood with
        confidence.
      </p>

      <p>“Good gryom,” he said approvingly.</p>

      <p>
        “Good what?” I asked. He said that word with a strange vowel — something
        between “e” and “yo.” I’d heard it before. From Sandr.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Gryom. That’s the word. The UAZ is gryom, the grinder is gryom, a clock
        is gryom…”
      </p>

      <p>“A mechanism? A machine?”</p>

      <p>
        “Sort of, but not exactly. Any kind of complicated thing. Just a word —
        doesn’t matter.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Gryom!” Sandr agreed emphatically. They both pronounced it exactly the
        same way.
      </p>

      <p>“Can I start the engine?” Yozzi asked.</p>

      <p>
        I was planning to roll the UAZ into the garage anyway, so I just climbed
        in and hit the starter. The engine fired up immediately, but when cold,
        that odd ticking was louder. The three of us stood there staring into
        the open hood as the fan blade sliced the air. Sandr shuffled around,
        looking at Yozzi expectantly. Yozzi stayed silent. I shrugged and got
        behind the wheel, slipped it into first gear, and gently rolled into the
        garage. I’d had enough crawling around in the dirt for one day.
      </p>

      <p>
        When the engine stopped and I stepped back outside, Sandr couldn’t hold
        it in anymore:
      </p>

      <p>“Yozzi, tell him, tell him! It's wrong, tell him!”</p>

      <p>Yozzi winced slightly, but eventually, almost reluctantly, said:</p>

      <p>
        “The exhaust valve seat on cylinder two is cracked. It’s slipped
        slightly from the socket, and the valve is tapping. It could crumble.
        Should replace it.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Oh, just like that? A crack, on cylinder two specifically?” I couldn’t
        help but laugh. It felt like some sort of prank. Maybe they wanted to
        see if I’d waste a day pulling the cylinder head off. I don’t know. But
        I do know this — you can’t hear that kind of thing from the engine’s
        sound. I may not be the world’s best mechanic, but I know the limits of
        what’s possible.
      </p>

      <p>
        Yozzi gave Sandr a look that clearly said, “See? Told you so.” Sandr got
        excited:
      </p>

      <p>“Yozzi knows! Knows!”</p>

      <p>
        Great. Another “artist who sees it.” And I’m supposed to just tear off
        the head based on that? Yeah, right. I already have enough on my plate —
        the brakes aren’t done, the steering box has a huge play…
      </p>
      <p>
        Yozzi, however, wasn’t offended at all by my clear skepticism, and
        didn’t push his diagnosis. Later, when I got to know him better, I
        realized this was part of his idea of politeness — a kind of code about
        respecting someone’s mental space. He gave his opinion, and even if he
        was completely sure he was right, he left the decision to others. It
        wasn’t indifference — more like a personal etiquette.
      </p>

      <p>“Beer?” Yozzi said with a wide smile.</p>

      <p>“Sounds good,” I agreed without argument.</p>

      <p>And off we went for a beer.</p>
